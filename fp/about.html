            <p>It feels like art and painting has always been a strong presence in my life. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been making some kind of art. But the passion took a turn in middle school when I had an art teacher who really changed how I saw art in general. They encouraged exploration of our own subject interests in a way that I had never been assigned before. It allowed me to really understand how much art moved me when I could interpret and create it how I wanted. Around that time I also realized how much energy and emotion I wanted and needed to put into my work. What started off as hesitant drawings and unsure paintings, slowly over the years turned into a long stretched out journey to figure out where my art fits into my own world and existence. To this day, I am still on that journey. As are all artists per the way I view creators of all kinds. We will constantly be evolving and growing as artists, even after we find the styles and subjects that we choose to focus and put dedication to. Now, my art feels a little closer to what I want to accomplish with it. I’m getting closer to the style I aspire for with each piece. My inspiration is drawn from my emotions and endless thoughts, daydreams and nightmares, and the appreciation of all colors. Going forward in the future, I hope to continue to work and focus on the series I have already started. Such as my “Noc” series and circle studies. They have been the most intriguing pieces I’ve worked on over the years and where I find the most inspiration to continue. By the end of creating a piece, I hope that it feels like a story is being told behind it. That the viewer wants to look twice and contemplate it. Maybe even place themselves in the spot of the subject and how they would feel. A sense of otherworldliness. At the moment I make a lot of pet portraits, but I plan to shift my focus to working on more original pieces and making myself known for more than just those oh so loved critters people trust me to paint. A subject matter I plan to delve more into is the concepts of dreams and nightmares. They have always been something of a major interest of mine. In some of my pieces I have tried to start to incorporate those subjects or the essence of them. But as I continue my research into dreams and nightmares, I aim to incorporate and more blatantly explore the concepts into my work.</p>
