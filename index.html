    <p>Hello, my name is Sebastian Linhart I am an emerging web developer currently in my second year at Seattle Central Community College, working towards a degree in Web Development. My ventures into web development started three years ago, a journey that has been both challenging and enlightening. My academic pursuits at the college, alongside a few personal projects, have served as the main avenues for my growth in this field. Although the personal projects are no longer accessible, they played a crucial role in my early exploration of web development, providing me with valuable hands-on experience despite the steep learning curve.</p>
        
    <p>While I would consider myself comfortable with Python and HTML, I approach these technologies with a sense of humility and eagerness to learn more. My experience with Python allows me to understand backend functionalities and automation processes, albeit with room for further mastery. Similarly, my knowledge of HTML provides me with a solid foundation in web structure and design, though I continues to seek deeper understanding and proficiency. As I continue to progress through my academic program, I remain focused on improving my coding skills and expanding my web development toolkit. My goal is to become a full-time developer, fully aware that the path ahead requires ongoing learning and adaptation.</p>
